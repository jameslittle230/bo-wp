# Bowdoin Orient Wordpress Application

## Purpose

This is a WordPress site based on [Roots' Bedrock WordPress boilerplate](https://roots.io/bedrock/). It treats the theme and custom plugins as application source code, and treats WordPress and external plugins as Composer dependencies.

This is an experimental rewrite of [The Bowdoin Orient site](https://bowdoinorient.com), optimized for developer experience and user experience (rather than the current site, which is optimized for longevity). If I could rewrite everything and maintain it forever, I'd use this.

## Development

* [**Composer:**](https://getcomposer.org/) PHP Package Manager. Used to install application dependencies like WordPress and plugins.
* [**NPM:**](https://www.npmjs.com/) Node Package Manager. Used to install development dependencies like Gulp and PostCSS.
